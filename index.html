  <h1> Bitcoin Tweet Sentiment Analysis and Price Prediction </h1>
  <p>In this project, I attempt to predict the next-day price movement of bitcoin.  I walk through my entire process from cleaning the data to building a logistic regression classifier.  I did most of the data cleaning in python and a little in sqlite.  I used R for all of the model building.</p>
  <p>My motivation for doing this project was out of a general interest for cryptocurrencies and to serve as a learning experience.  Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile.  This is what makes people love crypto as well as what terrifies people about crypto.  The huge volatility in the markets sets up a high-risk high-reward setting.  If someone were able to predict the markets, thereby mitigating this high-risk, the payoff could be immense.</p>
  <p>While working on this project, I was not expecting to build a model that would be useful.  There are entire corporations that dedicate a vast amount of resources for predicting the markets.  Even with all those resources, it is still quite difficult to make sense of bitcoin's volatility.  There was no way I could compete, but nonetheless, I really enjoyed the overall learning process.</p>
  <p>I decided to focus on bitcoin twitter sentiment for price prediction after seeing firsthand just how impactful market sentiment can be...especially in the crypto world.  Back in May of 2021, a single tweet from Elon Musk sent the entire crypto market in a downward spiral.  This event, and the negative sentiment that followed, inspired me to work on this project.  There are **many** other factors, than sentiment alone, that affect bitcoin pricing.  Therefore, the best case is that my model could explain only a fraction of bitcoin's variance.  However, I hope to improve my model in the future by adding more data/predictors. </p>
